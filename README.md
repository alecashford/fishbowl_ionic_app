#Fishbowl
===

Fishbowl is a mobile-only social network intended to create self-enclosed, exclusive communities (fishbowls). Fishbowls can be created and joined one of two ways: with an institutional email address or a secret code. For example, if you want to be join your university's fishbowl, you can join with your student email address. If you want to make a fishbowl for your building or neighborhood, you can do so by having a secret code generated, which can be given to any person who you wish to invite to be a member of that community. Fishbowls are intended to function like a community bulletin board. Once you are a memeber of a community, you will be able to post to that community's feed under your real name or anonymously, see all posts from the last 24 hours, and reply to all posts, and to all replies. The message boards are styled after reddit's; each post and reply can be upvoted and downvoted, and replies are nested to stimulate active discussion threads within a single post.

The current version is stil a work-in-progress undergoing active development. The mobile app itself is made using Ionic, an innovative boilerplate/framework for creating hybrid mobile apps using web development technologies, in particular AngularJS. The API that the app commmunicates with and handles all of the server-side logic is written in Ruby, through the Sinatra framework. The database is PostgreSQL.
